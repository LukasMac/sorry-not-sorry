        <h1>Rules</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>Setup:</strong> The game is for 2-10 players, ages 7 and over.
          Every player starts with seven cards, and they are dealt face down.
          The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. Next to the
          pile a space should be designated for a Discard Pile. The top card
          should be placed in the Discard Pile, and the game begins!
        </p>

        <p><strong>Card deck is composed of these cards:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Regular cards:</strong></p>
        <p>
          All regular cards have a number from 0 to 10 (excluding 9, because it
          can be easily confused with 6) and also a background color which can
          be one of four colors: amber, violet, turquoise, rouge.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are 8 cards of each number (two for each color) except 0
            number cards. There are only 4 cards with number 0 - one for each
            number.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Action Cards:</strong> Besides the number cards, there are
          several other cards that help mix up the game. These are called Action
          or Symbol cards.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Reverse</strong> – If going clockwise, switch to
            counterclockwise or vice versa. It can only be played on a card that
            matches by color, or on another Reverse card. If turned up at the
            beginning of play, the dealer goes first, and the player to the
            dealer’s right is next (normally it would be the player to the
            dealer’s left). There are in total 4 reverse cards, one for each
            color.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Skip</strong> – When a player places this card, the next
            player has to skip their turn. It can only be played on a card that
            matches by color, or on another Skip card. If turned up at the
            beginning of play, the first player (to the dealer’s left) loses
            his/her turn. The next player to that player’s right starts the game
            instead. There are in total 4 skip cards, one for each color.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Draw Two</strong> – When a person places this card, the next
            player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn. It
            can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another
            Draw Two. If turned up at the beginning of play, the first player
            draws two cards and gets skipped. There are in total 8 skip cards,
            two for each color.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wild</strong> – This card represents all four colors, and
            can be placed on any card. The player has to state which color it
            will represent for the next player. It can be played regardless of
            whether another card is available. If turned up at the beginning of
            play, the first player chooses what color to continue play. This
            card cancels silent mode and players can start talking again. There
            are in total 2 wild cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wild shhh mode</strong> – This card represents all four
            colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which
            color it will represent for the next player. It can be played
            regardless of whether another card is available. If turned up at the
            beginning of play, the first player chooses what color to continue
            play. This card also means that players can not talk anymore and if
            anyone says any work they take two cards as a penalty. There are in
            total 2 wild shhh cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wild Draw Four</strong> – This acts just like the wild card
            except that the next player also has to draw four cards as well as
            forfeit his/her turn. With this card, you must have no other
            alternative cards to play that matches the color of the card
            previously played. If you play this card illegally, you may be
            challenged by the other player to show your hand to him/her. If
            guilty, you need to draw 4 cards. If not, the challenger needs to
            draw 6 cards instead. If turned up at the beginning of play, return
            this card to the Draw pile, shuffle, and turn up a new one. There
            are 4 wild draw four cards in total.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Swap hands</strong> - There are 2 swap cards in the deck.
            Player who plays it can swap his/her hands with any player of
            his/her choice. This card does not have a color therefore the
            previous card decides the color.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Challenge player of your choice</strong> - Player who plays
            this card has to challenge any player of his/her choice. The
            challenge is simple, you both count to three and on number three
            with your finger you show either one or two fingers. If both of you
            show the same amount of fingers then the challenged player draws two
            cards otherwise the challenger draws two cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Number card 7</strong> - once this card is played all
            players have to put their hand in the middle and the player who is
            the last one draws two cards as a penalty.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Game Play:</strong> The first player is normally the player to
          the left of the dealer (you can also choose the youngest player) and
          gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction. Every player views
          his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action.
          For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have
          to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also
          play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their
          cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a card from
          the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep
          the card, and the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can
          also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a player before you plays “wild draw four” or “draw two card” the
          next player either draws four or two cards respectively OR the player
          can pass it to the next player by playing draw four or draw two cards
          respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the very first card is an action card then put it back to the
          middle of the draw pile and take another card on the top until it’s
          not an action card anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any time during the game, if the Draw Pile becomes depleted and no
          one has yet won the round, take the Discard Pile, shuffle it, and turn
          it over to regenerate a new Draw Pile.
        </p>

        <!-- ... (Rest of the content continues similarly) ... -->

        <p>
          Generally making any type of mistake during game play means that
          player who made a mistake must draw two cards as a penalty.
        </p>
